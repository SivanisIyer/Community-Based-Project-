# Community-connect
#Community connect:

As part of my Semester 5 Community Connect course, I had the opportunity to visit an NGO, where I interacted with children and participated in various activities.
Engaging with them was a heartwarming experience as I assisted in educational and recreational tasks, helping to create a positive and encouraging environment.
Through this visit, I gained valuable insights into the importance of empathy, active listening, and the impact of small efforts in making a difference. 
This experience reinforced my understanding of social responsibility and the power of education in shaping young minds, inspiring me to contribute more to community initiatives in the future.
